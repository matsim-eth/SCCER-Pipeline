%% This is an example for writing a paper at the IVT.
%% It supports English and German language.
%% By using it, it is possible to switch paper layouts easily
%% (e.g., working paper style into TRB style)
%%
%% The easiest way to write you own paper is to create an
%% appropriate directory stucture in the papers subdirectory
%% i.e. papers/strc/2007/mypaper,
%% copy this template and modify it there.
%%
%% See the note below on renaming the main file.
%%
%% Each keyword is documented. Just follow the instructions...
%% Enjoy!

%% IMPORTANT NOTE ON FILE RENAMES:
%%   If you rename this file, look for the text "Template"
%%   in all files and change this to the new filename, too.
%%   In Linux/Mac OS X/Windows+cygwin: Execute the following command
%%     in the template directory (substitute NewName by the new
%%     base of the new file name):
%%
%%     find -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec sed -i 's/[T]emplate/NewName/g' \{\} \+
%%     mmv 'T''emplate.*' 'NewName.#1'
%%
%%   In Windows (vanilla): Use your favorite find-in-text-files tool

%% ABSTRACT (first language)
%%   You can write it just here, if you want. You can also include
%%   an external .tex file (for better organization of you paper)
%%   The abstract MUST always be embedded into a command:
%%     \createabstract{
%%     This is an
%%     example abstract.
%%     }
%%   Be sure that your abstract is embedded into the curly brackets.
%%
%%   You can also put the abstract in a seperate .tex file for better
%%   organization. The command then is:
%%     \input{abstract-first}
%%   see also below (include sections)
\input{Abstract}
\input{Introduction}
\input{Methodology}
\input{Results}
