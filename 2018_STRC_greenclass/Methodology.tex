Pipeline for processing of GPS traces
 - filtering of waypoints
 - map matching using graphhopper
 - remove matched trips that have an average speed over 120kmh, or a duration less than 1 minute - 9\% of trips removed.
 - calculate link entry and exit times - simple formula
 - convert to matsim events
 - run traces through event processing to calculate externalities
 	- for emissions cap link average speed at link freespeed 
 	- road types taken from OSM
 	- end result is calculation of emissions and delays for each trip leg
